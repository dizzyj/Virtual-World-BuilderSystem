## Builder System

### CSCI 540 Virtual Worlds - Group 5
#### Spring 2023 

David Jenson, Evan Johnson, Ryan Turner, Katie Christensen

The Builder System provides an outlet for user creativity by presenting the tools that allow users to create structures in a persistent (continues to exist even when there are no users present) Virtual World. Through the use of primitive objects, users can stack, move, color, and group to save their creations as prefabs (create and group objects as reusable assets). This functionality allows users to customize their experience in the Virtual World based on their individual presences and needs. The system will provide users with the ability to manipulate shapes, scale, dimensions, and rotation of their 3D space and objects. 

| Key | Task |
| ------ | ------|
| L Shift | Select or deselect objects |
|L Control | Enter shrink mode |
| Q | Rotate the object left |
| E | Rotate the object right |
| R | Scale in the y axes |
| F | Scale in the x axes |
| G | Scale in the z axes |
| T | Expand the object |
| Z | Delete the object (when it is pre-selected) |
| v | Show inventory |

### Current System
* Place pimitives from inventory into the world.
* Modify primitives in the world (position, rotation, scale).
* Clear all placed primitives in the world.
* Group objects in the world - saved to inventory as prefabs.
* Place prefabs from inventory into the world.
* Modify prefabs in the world (position, rotation, scale).
* Clear all prefabs in the world.
* Modify individual objects within prefabs.
* Inventory and spawning limits.
* Persistent inventory with primitives and prefabs. 
* Networking on primitives and prefabs so other players see objects placed and modified.

### Future Work
* Future students should consider implementing persistence and further networking of the objects to allow users to have a better shared experience using the system. One could do this by integrating a database into the system.
* Modifying the control scheme UI to be more intuitive and user friendly.
* Sharing saved prefabs between users. 
* Implementing a permissions system to limit the actions others can take on one's objects.
* Changing color and material of objects.
* Update the inventory to show the newly saved prefab when a user groups objects together. Currently, the user has to save the prefab, exit the world, and then re-open the world and the inventory will then be updated.
* Change the keys x, y, and z when scaling in the x, y and z dimensions.
* Rotation and scaling should be able to specify a number and modify the object respectively.
