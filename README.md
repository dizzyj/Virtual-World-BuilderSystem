This project started as a University assignment where I collaborated with three other students. Bottom line up front: we didn't meet our own expectations due to a plethera of hardware issues (one of my peers couldnt access unity on the University machines) and probably many more excuses I can make we didn't finish. The original readme does a good job of outlining what we planned but didn't accomplish.

The goal for this project is to finish what was started in my own time. I plan on updating the user experience, properly networking the movment of objects, and persistence (both concerning the world, and each player's inventory).
